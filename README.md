# Student template

## Purpose of this repository

This is a project template for students participating in the Software Testing course
at Tampere University.

The repository only contains the source code that is under testing, the `package.json` skeleton
and LICENSE file.

The source code folder contains a separate license file that must **NOT** be removed under any circumstances!
Removing this license file directly violates the terms and conditions of the software under testing.
Individuals who remove or modify the license file will also carry the consequences.

Reused the code template from: https://github.com/otula/COMP.SE.200-2023-2024-1
